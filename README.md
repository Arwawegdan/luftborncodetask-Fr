# React + Vite
Hi! I'm a full-stack developer passionate about building scalable, maintainable, and user-friendly applications. This repository showcases a robust todo list app demonstrating my expertise in both back-end and front-end development.

Features:

ReactJS Front-end:
Utilizes three well-structured ReactJS pages for a clear and organized user interface.
Leverages Tailwind CSS for rapid, responsive styling.
Focuses on a user-centric design for an intuitive experience.
